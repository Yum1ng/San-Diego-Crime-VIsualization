Notes:

To run the code, you need to install (python 2.7)
1. numpy
2. uszipcode - pip install uszipcode
3. gmplot - please install from the github repo directly, the pip install will only give you an outdated version.
- pip install git+https://github.com/vgm64/gmplot.git
4. The code uses google service to work, the service key was removed for privacy, the user need to have a valid google service key to run the code.
5. The full_project_classes.py cleans up all the code and is well commented, this is the final version of our project
